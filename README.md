Introduction

This project aims to predict home prices based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle, containing various attributes such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. The objective is to build a robust model that accurately predicts home prices, providing insights for potential buyers and sellers.
Dataset

    Source: Kaggle Home Price Dataset
    Description: The dataset includes numerous features related to home characteristics, such as:
        Square Footage: Total living area.
        Number of Bedrooms: Total bedrooms in the house.
        Location: Neighborhood and other geographical features.
        Age of the House: Years since construction.
        Amenities: Features like swimming pools, garages, etc.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries:
        Pandas
        NumPy
        Scikit-learn
        Matplotlib
        Seaborn
        Jupyter Notebook

Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/home_price_prediction.git
cd home_price_prediction

Install the required packages:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Run the EDA notebook to understand the dataset and visualize key features:

    bash

jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA.ipynb

Model Training: Train the model by executing the model script:

bash

python models/model.py

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using the evaluation script:

bash

    python models/evaluation.py

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of XX% (or other relevant metrics, e.g., RMSE). Visualizations in the EDA notebook show correlations between features and target prices, helping to understand influential factors in pricing.
Future Work

    Explore additional features for improving model accuracy.
    Implement advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
    Deploy the model as a web application for user interaction.
